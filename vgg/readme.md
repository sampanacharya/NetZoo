# VGG
This is a Tensorflow implementation of VGG architecture that solved the ImageNet problem. 
This implementation contains all the architectures introduced in the original paper, following is a list of VGG architectures:
1. VGG11 - 11 Weight layers
2. VGG13 - 13 weight layers
3. VGG16 - 16 Weight layers
4. VGG19 - 19 Weight layers
